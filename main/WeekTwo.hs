    14. First Bad Version

    You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new 
    product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the 
    quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous 
    version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

    Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out 
    the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

    You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether 
    version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. 
    You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
